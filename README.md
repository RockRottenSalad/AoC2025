# Advent of Code 2025 - Haskell

Non-optimal AoC 2025 solutions.
Use this as a reference if you want to degrade the quality of your code.

So far, using Haskell. Might use Python, might use both or something else. Who
knows?

Remember to compile solutions using -O3 if you want the program to finish executing before the heat death of the universe.
```
ghc -dynamic -O3 solution.hs
```
